# Flood Monitoring Dashboard

This project is a **React + TypeScript** application that fetches and displays real-time flood monitoring data from the [Environment Agency Flood Monitoring API](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference) for the UK. The application includes a user-friendly interface and caches data locally to improve performance and reduce API calls.
